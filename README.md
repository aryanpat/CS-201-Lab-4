# CS-201-Lab-4
In Lab 4, I used If and While loops along with Switch expressions to make lists and number pyramids.

# What I Learned
I was able to learn how to use If and While loops and intergreate them into my code for less repetition and cleaner code. I also learned how to use the Switch expression which can help massively when trying to sort values out from a long list.
